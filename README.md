# End to End Asp.Net Core ~~3.1~~ 6 API and Blazor

### Course Link:

- https://www.udemy.com/course/end-to-end-aspnet-core-31-api-and-blazor-development/

### Obs:

- The instructor uses Visual Studio 2022, but I'm sticking on Visual Studio Code
  - By doing this, I'll need to use lots of cli commands, such as <code>dotnet</code>, <code>git</code>, etc.
- To see the workspace settings, check the _end-to-end-aspnet-core-31-api-and-blazor-development.code-workspace_ file
- To see the extensions, launch and tasks settings, check the _.vscode_ folder inside _BookStoreApp_
